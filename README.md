### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Mary, a person who loves optimizations and trial & error, and that's not just because I work on Growth. I also love to learn and ask questions, so don't be alarmed if I inundate you with questions about what you do. I'm just a curious cat. 

##### âš¡ Below the fold ;), I like to play volleyball, do martial arts, play with video creation and read books. 
##### âš¡ Fun fact: I'm Canadian and I moved to San Francisco during the pandemic times and have survived to tell the tale.
