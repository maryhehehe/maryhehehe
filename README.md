## Fun facts about me 
- 🥊 Martial arts and [Aerial silks](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiGvr-Lpzog/) keep me happy and they make me feel like a kid again. 
- ⛑ I worked for a mental health company. That experience taught me about how to create safe spaces for myself and others.  
- 🥝 Healthy eating is important to me, because I believe that my health is my wealth. 
- 📚 Actively [coaching](https://medium.com/@Maryhehehe/the-impact-of-coaching-cafa3104d40c) and mentoring designers makes me happy because I can make an impact by helping someone grow. 
- 👾 Video games are nostalgic, they remind me of the fun parts of childhood, and playing games keeps me curious and happy. 
- 🌎 I'm a big dreamer. Every day I hope to live the life of my dreams, and I hope to dream big enough that life feels meaningful. 

## What I'm learning these days
- 🚙 Believe it or not, I can't drive. It's okay, soon we will have spaceships, so I wouldn't need to drive. For now though, I'm learning how to drive.
- 🍄 As a nature lover, I want to have a better understanding of the Earth and I'm starting to learn more about mushrooms.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I've also been fascinated by code for a long time, and I'm learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and a little bit of Kotlin
