👋 Hi I'm Mary!

I work at GitHub's [Growth Design team](https://github.com/github/brand-marketing-design/) ❤️


# Fun facts about me 
- 🥊 Martial arts and [Aerial silks](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiGvr-Lpzog/) keep me happy and they make me feel like a kid again. 
- ⛑ I used to work for a mental health company, and that experience taught me about how to create safe spaces for myself and others.  
- 🥝 Healthy eating is important to me, because I believe that my health is my wealth. 
- 📚 Actively [coaching](https://medium.com/@Maryhehehe/the-impact-of-coaching-cafa3104d40c) and mentoring designers makes me happy because I can make an impact on someone by helping them grow. 
- 👾 Video games are nostalgic for me, they remind me of the fun times from childhood, and playing them keeps me curious and happy. 
- 🌎 I'm a big dreamer and I live between worlds where I hope to live the life of my dreams, and I hope to dream big enough that life feels meaningful to me.
